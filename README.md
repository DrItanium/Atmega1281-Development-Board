This is a simple development board for the QFP version of the ATMEGA1281. The
layout of the connector is an extended superset of the digital header found on
the Arduino Mega + an internal MajorCore development board I have also
created. 

The rest of the pins are laid out to make it trivial to design plugin boards
for my ecore and SxChipset projects.

The board is designed for the AISLER PCB manufacturing service.
